    "## Predicting Sale Price of Houses\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of the project is to build a machine learning model to predict the sale price of homes based on different explanatory variables describing aspects of residential houses.\n",

    "\n",
    "Predicting house prices is useful to identify fruitful investments or to determine whether the price advertised for a house is over or under-estimated.\n",
